The aim is to understand the Global Population Trends from the year 1800 to 2100.

Python3 is used in this project. This helps me practice modules like matplotlib and pandas.

Note:
The data file (xlsx) has been retrieved from gapminder.org
The data set is free to use. 

Work List:
1)Total Population Trend (1800 to 2100)
2)Region Wise Population Trend (1800 to 2100)
